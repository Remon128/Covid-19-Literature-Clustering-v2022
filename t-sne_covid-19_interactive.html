Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is&lt;br&gt;a rare condition usually occurring among adults&lt;br&gt;who have undergone solid organ transplant and are&lt;br&gt;taking steroid therapy. The coronavirus disease 2019&lt;br&gt;(COVID-19) virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in&lt;br&gt;gastrointestinal epithelium as a receptor for entry process. Due&lt;br&gt;to the steroid intake, the COVID-19 virus is&lt;br&gt;present in the patient's gastrointestinal tract for&lt;br&gt;extended period of time. It may therefore increase the&lt;br&gt;possibility of PI in such patients. It is usually&lt;br&gt;asymptomatic, with a clinical spectrum ranging from indolent&lt;br&gt;to life-threatening.

Using&lt;br&gt;information-theoretic inference, we answer this question with a&lt;br&gt;dictionary of 1,493 substructures-called&lt;br&gt;concepts-typically at a subdomain level, based on an unbiased&lt;br&gt;subset of known protein structures. Each concept&lt;br&gt;represents a topologically conserved assembly of helices&lt;br&gt;and strands that make contact. Any protein&lt;br&gt;structure can be dissected into instances of concepts&lt;br&gt;from this dictionary. We dissected the Protein Data&lt;br&gt;Bank and completely inventoried all the concept&lt;br&gt;instances.

Acute tubular necrosis has been reported to be&lt;br&gt;the most common damage in these patients, probably&lt;br&gt;due to hemodynamic instability. However, other&lt;br&gt;complex processes may be involved, related to the&lt;br&gt;cytokine storm and the activation of innate and adaptive&lt;br&gt;immunity. Here, we describe a patient who developed an&lt;br&gt;antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated&lt;br&gt;vasculitis with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis&lt;br&gt;and lung involvement and an antiphospholipid&lt;br&gt;syndrome soon after severe acute respiratory syndrome&lt;br&gt;coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

In turn, graphs gained&lt;br&gt;a lot of attention due to their modeling&lt;br&gt;capabilities for several real-world phenomena ranging from&lt;br&gt;bioinformatics to social network analysis. However, the&lt;br&gt;attention has been recently moved towards hypergraphs,&lt;br&gt;generalization of plain graphs where multi-way relations&lt;br&gt;(other than pairwise relations) can be considered. In&lt;br&gt;this paper, four (hyper)graph kernels are proposed&lt;br&gt;and their efficiency and effectiveness are&lt;br&gt;compared in a twofold fashion.

A mechanism of action acting on&lt;br&gt;different phases of the viral cycle is assumed. In&lt;br&gt;addition to its in vitro antiviral properties, some&lt;br&gt;evidence also suggests immunomodulatory and&lt;br&gt;antifibrotic activity. These properties of azithromycin&lt;br&gt;could be useful in the treatment of viral respiratory&lt;br&gt;tract infections such as COVID-19.

Saliva and fecal samples&lt;br&gt;were collected monthly for 1 year from 44 female&lt;br&gt;Asian elephants that participated in three programs&lt;br&gt;(saddle-, bareback-, or no-riding), and analyzed for&lt;br&gt;glucocorticoids (GC) and immunoglobulin A (IgA). The&lt;br&gt;hypothesis was that better welfare would be associated&lt;br&gt;with low GC and high IgA concentrations. Both&lt;br&gt;biomarkers showed significant variation with respect to&lt;br&gt;camp size, riding activities,&lt;br&gt;tourist-to-elephant ratios and seasonality, but not always&lt;br&gt;consistently between feces and saliva, and not always in the&lt;br&gt;predicted direction.

However, auscultation is a subjective&lt;br&gt;practice and interpretations vary widely between&lt;br&gt;users. The digitization of auscultation acquisition&lt;br&gt;and interpretation is a particularly promising&lt;br&gt;strategy for diagnosing and monitoring infectious&lt;br&gt;diseases such as Coronavirus-19 disease where&lt;br&gt;automated analyses could help decentralise care and&lt;br&gt;better inform decision-making in telemedicine. This&lt;br&gt;protocol describes the standardised collection of lung&lt;br&gt;auscultations in COVID-19 triage sites and a deep learning&lt;br&gt;approach to diagnostic and prognostic modelling for&lt;br&gt;future incorporation into an intelligent autonomous&lt;br&gt;stethoscope benchmarked against human expert&lt;br&gt;interpretation."," The critical minerals and elements are natural&lt;br&gt;substances that are essential to modern life but have&lt;br&gt;insecure supply. This lack of a secure supply clashes&lt;br&gt;with the increasing importance of these elements,&lt;br&gt;especially given their use in technologies needed to&lt;br&gt;reduce global CO 2 emissions and mitigate against&lt;br&gt;anthropogenic climate change. In this contribution we review&lt;br&gt;the by-product nature of the critical minerals and&lt;br&gt;elements and the inherant uncertainties in reported&lt;br&gt;critical mineral and element annual production as well&lt;br&gt;as the relationships between these commodities&lt;br&gt;and main-product metals and associated&lt;br&gt;concentrates.

Learning to&lt;br&gt;read is a requirement for becoming a selfproviding&lt;br&gt;human being. However, while spoken language is&lt;br&gt;acquired naturally with exposure to language without&lt;br&gt;explicit instruction, reading and writing need to be&lt;br&gt;taught explicitly. Decades of research have shown&lt;br&gt;that well-structured teaching of phonological&lt;br&gt;awareness, letter knowledge, and letter-to-sound&lt;br&gt;mapping is crucial in building solid foundations for&lt;br&gt;the acquisition of reading. During the COVID-19&lt;br&gt;pandemic, children worldwide did not have access to&lt;br&gt;consistent and structured teaching and are, as a&lt;br&gt;consequence, predicted to be behind in the development of&lt;br&gt;their reading skills. Subsequent evidence confirms..."," With the emergence of COVID-19, improving&lt;br&gt;hygiene through handwashing with water and detergent&lt;br&gt;is a priority. This behavioural practice&lt;br&gt;requires that households have access to reliable&lt;br&gt;improved water. One measure that can provide an&lt;br&gt;invaluable source of information to measure access to&lt;br&gt;improved water supply is willingness to pay (WTP).&lt;br&gt;However, little is known about WTP for water during a&lt;br&gt;pandemic such as COVID-19.

The Paediatric&lt;br&gt;Rheumatology European Society (PReS) / European League&lt;br&gt;Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Taskforce has developed&lt;br&gt;international recommendations and standards for&lt;br&gt;transitional care and a growing evidence base supports the&lt;br&gt;positive benefits of such care. However, there is also&lt;br&gt;evidence that universal implementation has yet to be&lt;br&gt;realised. In 2020, against this background the COVID-19&lt;br&gt;pandemic arrived with significant impact on all our&lt;br&gt;lives, young and old, patient, public and&lt;br&gt;professional alike.

This study examines whether and how&lt;br&gt;exposure to news stories reporting the severe COVID-19&lt;br&gt;risk to smokers may influence smokers' emotional&lt;br&gt;responses (fear, anxiety, and sadness) and intentions to&lt;br&gt;take measures to quit smoking. Current smokers in&lt;br&gt;the US participated in an online experiment (N =&lt;br&gt;495) and were randomized to read smoking risk news&lt;br&gt;stories or news stories reporting the combined risk of&lt;br&gt;smoking and COVID-19. We found that combined risk news&lt;br&gt;stories lead to participants feeling more fearful and&lt;br&gt;sadder than..."," Children with congenital heart disease (CHD)&lt;br&gt;are at-risk for both COVID-19 and secondary&lt;br&gt;cardiovascular outcomes. Their increased cardiovascular&lt;br&gt;risk may be mitigated through physical activity,&lt;br&gt;but public health measures implemented for&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 can make physical activity challenging. We&lt;br&gt;objectively measured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on&lt;br&gt;physical activity, continuously measured by Fitbit TM&lt;br&gt;stepcounts, in children with CHD.\nStep-counts were&lt;br&gt;markedly lower in late March and early April 2020,&lt;br&gt;compared to 2019 and to early March 2020. It is vital to&lt;br&gt;understand how precautions for COVID-19 will impact the&lt;br&gt;health of children with CHD, especially if they&lt;br&gt;persist long-term."," The severe acute respiratory&lt;br&gt;syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein (S) is a&lt;br&gt;major target for neutralizing antibodies.&lt;br&gt;Retroviral SARS-CoV S pseudotypes have been constructed&lt;br&gt;and used to develop an in vitro&lt;br&gt;microneutralization assay that is both sensitive and specific for&lt;br&gt;SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. Neutralization&lt;br&gt;titers measured by this assay are highly correlated to&lt;br&gt;those measured by an assay using&lt;br&gt;replicationcompetent SARS-CoV. No cross-neutralization occurred&lt;br&gt;with human sera known to contain antibodies to&lt;br&gt;coronavirus strains OC43 and 229E.

Our measure&lt;br&gt;demonstrates several important advantages over the extant&lt;br&gt;measures of contagion. Traditional measures of&lt;br&gt;contagion, such as increase in correlation, could be&lt;br&gt;limited in scope since they are bivariate, whereas&lt;br&gt;contagion is often a regional or global market&lt;br&gt;phenomenon. The multiple comparisons that the binary&lt;br&gt;correlations require in such cases could yield inconclusive&lt;br&gt;or contradictory results and fail to capture the&lt;br&gt;broad effects..."," Pulmonary infections are among the most common&lt;br&gt;and important infectious diseases due to their&lt;br&gt;high morbidity and mortality, especially in older&lt;br&gt;and immunocompromised individuals. However, due&lt;br&gt;to the limitations in sensitivity and the long&lt;br&gt;turn-around time (TAT) of conventional diagnostic&lt;br&gt;methods, pathogen detection and identification&lt;br&gt;methods for pulmonary infection with greater&lt;br&gt;diagnostic efficiency are urgently needed. In recent&lt;br&gt;years, unbiased metagenomic next generation&lt;br&gt;sequencing (mNGS) has been widely used to detect different&lt;br&gt;types of infectious pathogens, and is especially&lt;br&gt;useful for the detection of rare and newly emergent&lt;br&gt;pathogens, showing better diagnostic performance than&lt;br&gt;traditional methods. There has been limited..."," Recent global outbreak of the pandemic caused&lt;br&gt;by coronavirus emphasizes the urgent need for&lt;br&gt;novel antiviral therapeutics. It can be&lt;br&gt;supplemented by utilization of efficient and validated drug&lt;br&gt;discovery approaches such as drug&lt;br&gt;repurposing/repositioning. The well reported and clinically used&lt;br&gt;anti-malarial aminoquinoline drugs (chloroquine and&lt;br&gt;hydroxychloroquine) have shown potential to be repurposed to&lt;br&gt;control the present pandemic by inhibition of&lt;br&gt;COVID-19. The review elaborates the mechanism of action,&lt;br&gt;safety (side effects, adverse effects, toxicity) and&lt;br&gt;worldwide clinical trials for chloroquine and&lt;br&gt;hydroxychloroquine to benefit the clinicians, medicinal chemist,&lt;br&gt;pharmacologist actively involved in the management of&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 infection."," This research introduces a new probabilistic&lt;br&gt;and meta-heuristic optimization approach&lt;br&gt;inspired by the Corona virus pandemic. Corona is an&lt;br&gt;infection that originates from an unknown animal virus,&lt;br&gt;which is of three known types and COVID-19 has been&lt;br&gt;rapidly spreading since late 2019. Based on the SIR&lt;br&gt;model, the virus can easily transmit from one person to&lt;br&gt;several, causing an epidemic over time. Considering the&lt;br&gt;characteristics and behavior of this virus, the current paper&lt;br&gt;presents an optimization algorithm called Corona virus&lt;br&gt;optimization (CVO) which is feasible, effective, and&lt;br&gt;applicable. A set of benchmark functions evaluates the&lt;br&gt;performance of this algorithm for..."," The paper investigates the effect that&lt;br&gt;subnational networks of immigrants and emigrants had on&lt;br&gt;exports from Spanish provinces (NUTS3) over the period&lt;br&gt;of 2007-2016 by integrating state-of-the-art&lt;br&gt;advances in the gravity model literature. In&lt;br&gt;particular, it allows for heterogeneity in provincial&lt;br&gt;export capacity, which significantly reduces&lt;br&gt;pro-export effects, and select the Poisson&lt;br&gt;Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood as the most suitable estimator&lt;br&gt;according to diagnostic tests. When both immigration and&lt;br&gt;emigration are instrumented, the pro-export effect of&lt;br&gt;immigrants found by previous studies vanishes and that of&lt;br&gt;emigrants, instead, appears appreciable. The results&lt;br&gt;obtained suggest that over the period that encompasses&lt;br&gt;the double-deep crisis,..."," Theileria parva (T. parva) causes East Coast&lt;br&gt;fever (ECF), which is of huge economic importance to&lt;br&gt;Eastern and Southern African countries. In a previous&lt;br&gt;bovine model, inflammatory cytokines were closely&lt;br&gt;associated with disease progression in animals&lt;br&gt;experimentally infected with T. parva. The African Cape&lt;br&gt;buffalo (Syncerus caffer), the natural reservoir for&lt;br&gt;T. parva, is completely resistant to ECF despite a&lt;br&gt;persistently high parasitaemia following infection with T.&lt;br&gt;parva. Characterizing basic immunological&lt;br&gt;interactions in the host is critical to understanding the&lt;br&gt;mechanism underlying disease resistance in the African&lt;br&gt;Cape buffalo. In this study, the expression level of&lt;br&gt;several cytokines was analyzed..."," Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a powerful&lt;br&gt;classification method and is very competitive among existing&lt;br&gt;classification methods. It is speedy at training.&lt;br&gt;Nevertheless, it cannot perform face verification tasks&lt;br&gt;properly because face verification tasks require the&lt;br&gt;comparison of facial images of two individuals&lt;br&gt;simultaneously and decide whether the two faces identify the&lt;br&gt;same person. The ELM structure was not designed to&lt;br&gt;feed two input data streams simultaneously. Thus,&lt;br&gt;in 2-input scenarios, ELM methods are typically&lt;br&gt;applied using concatenated inputs.

This overview departs from the central, but&lt;br&gt;static, role of human behavior in traditional&lt;br&gt;mathematical models of infection to motivate the importance&lt;br&gt;of including behavior into epidemiological&lt;br&gt;models. Our aim is threefold. First, we attempt to&lt;br&gt;motivate the historical and cultural background&lt;br&gt;underpinning the BE revolution, focusing on the issue of&lt;br&gt;rational opposition to vaccines as a natural endpoint of&lt;br&gt;the changed relation between man and disease in&lt;br&gt;modern industrialized countries. Second, we review&lt;br&gt;those contributions,..."," Background: To prevent the spread of&lt;br&gt;coronavirus disease , it is important to avoid 3Cs (closed&lt;br&gt;spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings).&lt;br&gt;However, the risk of contact with an unspecified number&lt;br&gt;of people is inevitable while commuting to and&lt;br&gt;from work. In this study, we investigated the&lt;br&gt;relationship between commuting, and the risk of COVID-19 and&lt;br&gt;COVID-19-induced anxiety. Methods: An internet-based&lt;br&gt;questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain a dataset from&lt;br&gt;27,036 respondents. One-way commuting time was&lt;br&gt;evaluated using a five-case method. The commuting&lt;br&gt;distance was estimated using zip codes of the home and&lt;br&gt;workplace. Logistic regression analysis was performed&lt;br&gt;with..."," The high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 makes it&lt;br&gt;essential to develop a rapid and accurate diagnostic test&lt;br&gt;so that carriers can be isolated at an early stage.&lt;br&gt;Viral RNA in nasopharyngeal samples by RT-PCR is&lt;br&gt;currently considered the reference method although it is&lt;br&gt;not recognized as a strong gold standard due to&lt;br&gt;certain drawbacks.

As CaPV strains are serologically&lt;br&gt;indistinguishable and genetically highly homologous, typing&lt;br&gt;closely related strains can only be achieved by whole&lt;br&gt;genome sequencing. Unfortunately the number of&lt;br&gt;publicly available genomes remains low as most&lt;br&gt;sequencing methods rely on virus isolation. Therefore, we&lt;br&gt;developed a robust, cost-effective and widely&lt;br&gt;applicable method that allows to generate (nearly)&lt;br&gt;complete CaPV genomes directly from clinical samples or&lt;br&gt;commercial vaccine batches. A set of pan-CaPVs long-range&lt;br&gt;PCRs spanning the entire genome was..."," Research suggests political identity has&lt;br&gt;strong influence over individuals' attitudes and&lt;br&gt;beliefs, which in turn can affect their behavior.&lt;br&gt;Likewise, firsthand experience with an issue can also&lt;br&gt;affect attitudes and beliefs. A large (N = 6,383)&lt;br&gt;survey (Pew Research and Ipsos W64) of Americans was&lt;br&gt;analyzed to investigate the effects of both political&lt;br&gt;identity (i.e., Democrat or Republican) and personal&lt;br&gt;impact (i.e., whether they suffered job or income&lt;br&gt;loss) on individuals' reactions to the COVID-19&lt;br&gt;pandemic. Results show that political identity and&lt;br&gt;personal impact influenced the American public's&lt;br&gt;attitudes about and response to COVID-19.

It estimates sensor nodes location&lt;br&gt;through detecting the hop count between nodes. To&lt;br&gt;enhance the positional precision, the weight is used to&lt;br&gt;estimate position, and the conventional wisdom is that&lt;br&gt;the more hop counts are, the smaller value of weight&lt;br&gt;will be. However, there has been no clear&lt;br&gt;mathematical model among positioning error, hop count, and&lt;br&gt;weight. This paper constructs a mathematical model&lt;br&gt;between the weights and hops and analyzes the&lt;br&gt;convergence of this model.

Instead,&lt;br&gt;development of effective mAbs against infectious diseases&lt;br&gt;has been lagging behind. For years the high&lt;br&gt;production cost and limited efficacy have blocked broader&lt;br&gt;application of mAbs in the infectious disease space, which&lt;br&gt;instead has been dominated for almost a century by&lt;br&gt;effective and cheap antibiotics and vaccines. Only very&lt;br&gt;few mAbs against RSV, anthrax, Clostridium&lt;br&gt;difficile or rabies have reached the market. This is about&lt;br&gt;to change.

However,&lt;br&gt;vaccineinduced immune responses are highly variable between&lt;br&gt;individuals and between populations in different regions&lt;br&gt;of the world. Understanding the basis of this&lt;br&gt;variation is, thus, of fundamental importance to human&lt;br&gt;health. Although the factors that are associated with&lt;br&gt;intra-and inter-population variation in vaccine&lt;br&gt;responses are manifold, emerging evidence points to a key&lt;br&gt;role for the gut microbiome in controlling immune&lt;br&gt;responses to vaccination.

Systemic&lt;br&gt;inflammation and coagulopathy are the two major factors that&lt;br&gt;provoke life-threatening organ dysfunction in&lt;br&gt;heatstroke. Dysregulated thermo-control induces&lt;br&gt;cellular injury, damage-associated molecular&lt;br&gt;patterns release, hyperinflammation, and&lt;br&gt;hypercoagulation with suppressed fibrinolysis to produce&lt;br&gt;heatstroke-induced coagulopathy (HSIC).

It was identified in Hong Kong in&lt;br&gt;2012. Given that neither specific antiviral drugs&lt;br&gt;nor vaccines are available for newly emerging&lt;br&gt;porcine deltacoronavirus, searching for effective&lt;br&gt;antiviral drugs is a high priority. In this study, lithium&lt;br&gt;chloride (LiCl) and diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG),&lt;br&gt;which are host-acting antivirals (HAAs), were&lt;br&gt;tested against PDCoV. We found that LiCl and DG&lt;br&gt;inhibited PDCoV replication in LLC-PK1 cells in a&lt;br&gt;dose-dependent manner. The antiviral effects of LiCl and DG&lt;br&gt;occurred at the early stage of PDCoV replication, and DG..."," Background: Young people in low-and&lt;br&gt;middle-income countries are often neglected in designing&lt;br&gt;youth-friendly health services, especially HIV testing and&lt;br&gt;preventive services.

Data about&lt;br&gt;pandemic-related mental health support use,&lt;br&gt;socio-demographics, mood, lifestyle, social rhythm and subjective&lt;br&gt;cognitive dysfunction data were collected and compared&lt;br&gt;between groups. Inter-relationships between..."," Background: Professional communities such as&lt;br&gt;the medical community are acutely concerned with&lt;br&gt;negligence: the category of misconduct where a&lt;br&gt;professional does not live up to the standards expected of a&lt;br&gt;professional of similar qualifications. Since science is&lt;br&gt;currently strengthening its structures of&lt;br&gt;self-regulation in parallel to the professions, this raises the&lt;br&gt;question to what extent the scientific community is&lt;br&gt;concerned with negligence, and if not, whether it should&lt;br&gt;be. By means of comparative analysis of medical and&lt;br&gt;scientific codes of conduct, we aim to highlight the role&lt;br&gt;(or lack thereof ) of negligence provisions in&lt;br&gt;codes of conduct for scientists,..."," The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)&lt;br&gt;significantly disrupted human activities all over the world.&lt;br&gt;Despite this, little or nothing is known about mental&lt;br&gt;health and coping strategies during the COVID-19&lt;br&gt;pandemic among the unemployed and employed people in&lt;br&gt;Nigeria. Therefore, this study was an effort towards&lt;br&gt;bridging this knowledge gap. We employed a qualitative&lt;br&gt;design with 66 participants (age range = 18-62 years)&lt;br&gt;who described how the COVID-19 pandemic affected&lt;br&gt;their mental health and how they coped during the&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study,&lt;br&gt;we investigated the effect of the COVID-19&lt;br&gt;pandemic on the use of serotonergic psychedelics, i.e.,&lt;br&gt;the settings in which people use psychedelics, the&lt;br&gt;motives of usage, and the subjective quality of&lt;br&gt;psychedelic experiences.\nThe study was part of an&lt;br&gt;international, cross-sectional, internet-based survey (N =&lt;br&gt;5,049) available in five languages (English, German,&lt;br&gt;Spanish, Italian, and Korean) carried out during the&lt;br&gt;early phase of the pandemic..."," The COVID 19 pandemic has induced a sharp rise in&lt;br&gt;demand for consumables for laboratory diagnosis and,&lt;br&gt;in particular, for swabs for sampling&lt;br&gt;biomaterials. Test quality depends strongly on swab quality.&lt;br&gt;The aim of this work was to run experimental studies&lt;br&gt;to evaluate the physical and operational&lt;br&gt;properties of fiber type medical swabs. This study&lt;br&gt;compared swabs from leading manufacturers&lt;br&gt;traditionally regarded as the quality standard on the Russian&lt;br&gt;market in the premium sector: Copan Diagnostics&lt;br&gt;(Italy), Puritan Medical Products (PMP) (USA), and&lt;br&gt;PharmMedPolis (PhMP) (Russia).

Among these, we can find file&lt;br&gt;reformatting, sequence renaming, tree rerooting, tree&lt;br&gt;comparison, bootstrap support computation, etc. These are&lt;br&gt;often performed by custom scripts or by several&lt;br&gt;heterogeneous tools, which may be error prone, uneasy to&lt;br&gt;maintain and produce results that are challenging to&lt;br&gt;reproduce. For all these reasons, the development and&lt;br&gt;reuse of phylogenetic workflows is often a complex&lt;br&gt;task. We identified many operations that are part of&lt;br&gt;most phylogenetic analyses, and implemented them&lt;br&gt;in a toolkit called Gotree/Goalign. The..."," Polymeric materials have drastically changed&lt;br&gt;the society in the last century. However, their&lt;br&gt;nonrenewable origin, together with their indiscriminate&lt;br&gt;use and disposal, resulted in a huge accumulation&lt;br&gt;of waste in the environment and raised a wide&lt;br&gt;discussion about the emission of greenhouse gases, which&lt;br&gt;must be considerably reduced to minimize global&lt;br&gt;warming. Thus, the establishment of a consolidated&lt;br&gt;production of polymers prioritizing the use of renewable&lt;br&gt;sources of raw materials became a hot research topic.&lt;br&gt;Vegetable oils are protagonists of this initiative, and&lt;br&gt;their carbon-carbon double bonds are convenient&lt;br&gt;reactive sites for chain growth polymerization&lt;br&gt;reactions. However, typical vegetable oil-based..."," Free Energy Principle underlies a unifying&lt;br&gt;framework that integrates theories of origins of life,&lt;br&gt;cognition, and action. Recently, FEP has been developed&lt;br&gt;into a Markovian monist perspective (Friston et al.&lt;br&gt;in BC 102: 227-260, 2020). The paper expresses&lt;br&gt;scepticism about the validity of arguments for Markovian&lt;br&gt;monism. The critique is based on the assumption that&lt;br&gt;Markovian models are scientific models, and while we may&lt;br&gt;defend ontological theories about the nature of&lt;br&gt;scientific models, we could not read off metaphysical&lt;br&gt;theses about the nature of target systems&lt;br&gt;(self-organising conscious systems, in the present context)&lt;br&gt;from our theories of nature of scientific..."," A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t Purpose. Alvimopan is a&lt;br&gt;peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonist indicated&lt;br&gt;to accelerate gastrointestinal (GI) recovery&lt;br&gt;following surgery, but its benefits past GI recovery are&lt;br&gt;unknown and evidence suggests that it may increase risk&lt;br&gt;for myocardial infarction. The purpose of this&lt;br&gt;study was to evaluate the efficacy of a pilot&lt;br&gt;alvimopan stewardship program aimed at intervening to&lt;br&gt;discontinue alvimopan use following GI&lt;br&gt;recovery.\nMethods. This was a retrospective, observational study&lt;br&gt;examining the first 5 months of the alvimopan stewardship&lt;br&gt;pilot program. During this initial..."," The sense of smell helps us navigate the&lt;br&gt;environment, but its molecular architecture and underlying&lt;br&gt;logic remain understudied. The spatial location of&lt;br&gt;odorant receptor genes (Olfrs) in the nose is thought to&lt;br&gt;be independent of the structural diversity of the&lt;br&gt;odorants they detect. Using spatial transcriptomics,&lt;br&gt;we create a genome-wide 3D atlas of the mouse&lt;br&gt;olfactory mucosa (OM). Topographic maps of genes&lt;br&gt;differentially expressed in space reveal that both Olfrs and&lt;br&gt;non-Olfrs are distributed in a continuous and&lt;br&gt;overlapping fashion over at least five broad zones in the OM.&lt;br&gt;The spatial locations of Olfrs correlate with the&lt;br&gt;mucus solubility of..."," Background: The COVID-19 disease is putting&lt;br&gt;unprecedented pressure on the global healthcare system. The&lt;br&gt;CT (computed tomography) examination as a&lt;br&gt;auxiliary confirmed diagnostic method can help&lt;br&gt;clinicians quickly detect lesions locations of COVID-19&lt;br&gt;once screening by PCR test. Furthermore, the lesion&lt;br&gt;subtypes classification plays a critical role in the&lt;br&gt;consequent treatment decision. Identifying the subtypes&lt;br&gt;of lesions accurately can help doctors discover&lt;br&gt;changes in lesions in time and better assess the&lt;br&gt;severity of COVID-19.\nThe most four typical lesion&lt;br&gt;subtypes of COVID-19 are discussed in this paper, which&lt;br&gt;are GGO (ground-glass opacity), cord, solid and&lt;br&gt;subsolid.

The DDX DEAD box RNA&lt;br&gt;helicase is a multifunctional protein involved in all&lt;br&gt;aspects of RNA metabolism. Therefore, host RNA&lt;br&gt;helicases may regulate and maintain such a large viral RNA&lt;br&gt;genome. In this study, I investigated the potential&lt;br&gt;role of several host cellular RNA helicases in&lt;br&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, DDX21 knockdown markedly&lt;br&gt;accumulated intracellular viral RNA and viral production,&lt;br&gt;as well as viral infectivity of SARS-CoV-2,&lt;br&gt;indicating that DDX21 strongly restricts the SARS-CoV-2&lt;br&gt;infection.

The urgent need for such&lt;br&gt;diagnostic systems is recommended by experts in order to&lt;br&gt;achieve the mass and targeted SARS-CoV-2 detection&lt;br&gt;required to manage the COVID-19 pandemic through the&lt;br&gt;understanding of infection progression and timely therapy&lt;br&gt;decisions. To achieve these tasks, there is a scope for&lt;br&gt;developing smart sensors to rapidly..."," The inhalation route has a substantial&lt;br&gt;influence on the fate of inhaled particles. An outbreak of&lt;br&gt;infectious diseases such as COVID-19, influenza or&lt;br&gt;tuberculosis depends on the site of deposition of the inhaled&lt;br&gt;pathogens. But the knowledge of respiratory deposition is&lt;br&gt;important also for occupational safety or targeted&lt;br&gt;delivery of inhaled pharmaceuticals.\nSimulations&lt;br&gt;utilizing computational fluid dynamics are becoming&lt;br&gt;available to a wide spectrum of users and they can&lt;br&gt;undoubtedly bring detailed predictions of regional&lt;br&gt;deposition of particles.

Several studies have shown an&lt;br&gt;association of NAFLD with multiple cardiovascular risk&lt;br&gt;factors such as abdominal obesity, atherogenic&lt;br&gt;dyslipidaemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and&lt;br&gt;impaired glucose tolerance. Atherosclerosis is a&lt;br&gt;chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease, which&lt;br&gt;begins early in life and follows a long asymptomatic&lt;br&gt;phase. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is the&lt;br&gt;radiological confirmation of the presence of&lt;br&gt;atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The predictive value&lt;br&gt;of CAC for future cardiac events is well&lt;br&gt;established. Also, the progression..."," Continually improving crowd counting neural&lt;br&gt;networks have been developed in recent years. The&lt;br&gt;accuracy of these networks has reached such high levels&lt;br&gt;that further improvement is becoming very&lt;br&gt;difficult. However, this high accuracy lacks deeper&lt;br&gt;semantic information, such as social roles (e.g.,&lt;br&gt;student, company worker, or police officer) or&lt;br&gt;location-based roles (e.g., pedestrian, tenant, or&lt;br&gt;construction worker). Some of these can be learned from the&lt;br&gt;same set of features as the human nature of an entity,&lt;br&gt;whereas others require wider contextual information&lt;br&gt;from the human surroundings. The primary end-goal&lt;br&gt;of developing recognition software is to involve&lt;br&gt;them in autonomous decision-making..."," Chikungunya is a notorious viral infection,&lt;br&gt;which affects a large segment of world populations in&lt;br&gt;absence of vaccines and antivirals.

In the United&lt;br&gt;States today, the physician to patient deficit places&lt;br&gt;great strain on the availability of medical&lt;br&gt;attention tenable to patients nationwide; in terms of&lt;br&gt;specialty medicine, this deficit is even more&lt;br&gt;widespread. The field of ophthalmology faced the same&lt;br&gt;physician to patient deficit in 2020, a grim reality that&lt;br&gt;has left many states void of ophthalmic care,&lt;br&gt;rending millions of aging individuals without&lt;br&gt;domestic eye care. The implementation of trained,&lt;br&gt;ophthalmic nurse practitioners (NPs) can fill the needs..."," Influenza A virus (IAV) depends on the&lt;br&gt;metabolism of its cellular host to provide energy and&lt;br&gt;essential factors, including lipids, for viral&lt;br&gt;replication. Previous studies have shown that fatty acids&lt;br&gt;(FAs) play an important role in IAV replication and&lt;br&gt;that inhibition of FA biosynthesis can diminish&lt;br&gt;viral replication. However, cellular lipids can&lt;br&gt;either be synthesized intracellularly or be imported&lt;br&gt;from the extracellular environment. Interfering&lt;br&gt;with FA import mechanisms may reduce the cellular&lt;br&gt;lipid content and inhibit IAV replication. To test&lt;br&gt;this hypothesis, MDCK and Detroit 562 cells were&lt;br&gt;infected with IAV followed by exposure to palmitic acid&lt;br&gt;and inhibitors of..."," Brazil has 896,917 Indigenous individuals&lt;br&gt;distributed among 505 Indigenous lands.

In our&lt;br&gt;previous study, we have found that lipid-related&lt;br&gt;constituents in the host cellular membrane are associated&lt;br&gt;with the BmCPV life cycle. It is important to note&lt;br&gt;that the lipids not only affect the cellular&lt;br&gt;biological processes, they also impact the virus life&lt;br&gt;cycle. However, the intracellular lipid homeostasis&lt;br&gt;in BmN cells after BmCPV infection remains&lt;br&gt;unclear.

Due to the&lt;br&gt;biases of country-level data, it is inaccurate to&lt;br&gt;construct the global dynamic of COVID-19. This research&lt;br&gt;aims to provide a robust data-driven global model of&lt;br&gt;the transmission dynamics. We apply sparse&lt;br&gt;identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to model the&lt;br&gt;dynamics of COVID-19 global transmission. One&lt;br&gt;advantage is that we can discover the nonlinear dynamics&lt;br&gt;from data without assumptions in the form of the&lt;br&gt;governing equations.

We provide an overview on the current status of&lt;br&gt;vitamin D deficiency, the mechanisms of action of&lt;br&gt;vitamin D and the current literature on the topic, with a&lt;br&gt;special focus on the potential implications for&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 pandemic."," In daily life, there are a variety of complex&lt;br&gt;sound sources. It is important to effectively detect&lt;br&gt;certain sounds in some situations. With the outbreak of&lt;br&gt;COVID-19, it is necessary to distinguish the sound of&lt;br&gt;coughing, to estimate suspected patients in the&lt;br&gt;population. In this paper, we propose a method for cough&lt;br&gt;recognition based on a Mel-spectrogram and a Convolutional&lt;br&gt;Neural Network called the Cough Recognition Network&lt;br&gt;(CRN), which can effectively distinguish cough&lt;br&gt;sounds."," Objective: ADHD symptom severity appears to be&lt;br&gt;exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present&lt;br&gt;study surveyed top problems experienced by&lt;br&gt;adolescents and young adults (A/YAs) with ADHD during the&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 pandemic to identify possible reasons for&lt;br&gt;symptom escalation and potential targets for&lt;br&gt;intervention. We also explored perceived benefits of the&lt;br&gt;pandemic for A/YAs with ADHD. Method: At the outbreak of&lt;br&gt;the COVID-19 pandemic (April-June 2020), we&lt;br&gt;administered self and parent ratings about current and&lt;br&gt;pre-pandemic top problem severity and benefits of the&lt;br&gt;pandemic to a sample of convenience (N = 134 A/YAs with&lt;br&gt;ADHD participating in a prospective longitudinal&lt;br&gt;study)...."," Airborne transmission is an important&lt;br&gt;mechanism of spread for both viruses and bacteria in&lt;br&gt;hospitals, with nosocomial infections putting a great&lt;br&gt;burden on public health. In this study, we designed and&lt;br&gt;manufactured a bed for pediatric clinic consultation rooms&lt;br&gt;providing air isolation to protect patients and medical&lt;br&gt;personnel from pathogen transmission. The pediatric&lt;br&gt;isolation bed has several primary efficiency filters and&lt;br&gt;a high-efficiency particulate air filter in the&lt;br&gt;bedside unit.\nThe air circulation between inlet and&lt;br&gt;outlet forms negative pressure to remove the&lt;br&gt;patient's exhaled air timeously and effectively.

In this context, it&lt;br&gt;urgently needs to develop new rapid tools for quickly&lt;br&gt;predicting the affinity of ACE2 for the SARS-CoV-2 spike&lt;br&gt;RBD protein variants to be used with the ongoing&lt;br&gt;SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing activities in the clinics,&lt;br&gt;aiming to gain clues about the transmissibility and&lt;br&gt;virulence of new variants, to prevent new outbreaks and to&lt;br&gt;quickly estimate the severity of the disease in..."," The World Health Organization has recently&lt;br&gt;declared South America the new epicenter of the COVID-19&lt;br&gt;pandemic, as Brazil has become one of the most affected&lt;br&gt;countries. Besides public health and economic impacts,&lt;br&gt;social isolation has also caused indirect&lt;br&gt;environmental effects. The aim of this study was to assess&lt;br&gt;environmental impacts caused by shifts on solid waste&lt;br&gt;production and management due to the COVID-19 pandemic in&lt;br&gt;Brazil. We have analyzed data from 30 cities,&lt;br&gt;representing a population of more than 53.8 million people&lt;br&gt;(25.4% of the Brazilian population).

A systematic&lt;br&gt;review has been performed of papers published until 5&lt;br&gt;April 2020. 29 papers related to neurological&lt;br&gt;manifestations associated with COVID-19 were examined. The&lt;br&gt;results show presence of central and peripheral&lt;br&gt;nervous system manifestations related to&lt;br&gt;coronavirus. Neurological manifestations, or NeuroCOVID,&lt;br&gt;are part of the COVID-19 clinical picture, but&lt;br&gt;questions remain regarding the frequency and severity of&lt;br&gt;CNS symptoms, the mechanism of action underlying&lt;br&gt;neurological symptoms, and the relationship of symptoms..."," Rubella virus (RV) causes severe congenital&lt;br&gt;defects when acquired during the first trimester of&lt;br&gt;pregnancy. RV cytopathic effect has been shown to be due to&lt;br&gt;caspase-dependent apoptosis in a number of susceptible cell&lt;br&gt;lines, and it has been suggested that this apoptotic&lt;br&gt;induction could be a causal factor in the development of&lt;br&gt;such defects. Often the outcome of apoptotic&lt;br&gt;stimuli is dependent on apoptotic, proliferative and&lt;br&gt;survival signaling mechanisms in the cell. Therefore we&lt;br&gt;investigated the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase&lt;br&gt;(PI3K)-Akt survival signaling and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK&lt;br&gt;proliferative signaling during RV-induced apoptosis in RK13&lt;br&gt;cells. Increasing levels of phosphorylated ERK, Akt&lt;br&gt;and..."," In this work we introduce a framework, based on&lt;br&gt;threeway decision (TWD) and the&lt;br&gt;trisecting-acting-outcome model, to handle uncertainty in Machine&lt;br&gt;Learning (ML). We distinguish between handling&lt;br&gt;uncertainty affecting the input of ML models, when TWD is&lt;br&gt;used to identify and properly take into account the&lt;br&gt;uncertain instances; and handling the uncertainty lying&lt;br&gt;in the output, where TWD is used to allow the ML&lt;br&gt;model to abstain. We then present a narrative review&lt;br&gt;of the state of the art of applications of TWD in&lt;br&gt;regard to the different areas of concern identified by&lt;br&gt;the framework, and in so doing, we..."," Eurythenes S.I.

Surgical risk assessment in these patients is&lt;br&gt;often complex, considers all factors known to impact&lt;br&gt;short-and long-term outcomes, and the additional risk&lt;br&gt;that COVID-19 infection could convey in this&lt;br&gt;patient population is unknown. The European Centre for&lt;br&gt;Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published risk&lt;br&gt;factors (ECDC-RF) implicated in increased COVID-19&lt;br&gt;hospitalization and case-fatality which have been further&lt;br&gt;evidenced by initial reports from the United States&lt;br&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention...."," The myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa shasta has&lt;br&gt;been identified as the main contributor of&lt;br&gt;mortality in salmon in the Klamath River, California. The&lt;br&gt;life cycle of the parasite is complex, involving a&lt;br&gt;polychaete and a salmonid host. Infection dynamics are&lt;br&gt;greatly influenced by environmental factors, such as&lt;br&gt;temperature and water velocity. If we are to control the&lt;br&gt;disease it is important to predict the impact of&lt;br&gt;environmental scenarios on spore concentration and&lt;br&gt;infection prevalence.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)&lt;br&gt;converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II.&lt;br&gt;Angiotensin II, which binds the angiotensin II type-1&lt;br&gt;receptor (AT1R), is a potent vasoconstrictor. On a&lt;br&gt;pathophysiological basis, both ACE I/D and AT1R A1166C&lt;br&gt;polymorphism lead to an enhanced activity of the angiotensin&lt;br&gt;II-AT1R axis, thereby possibly contributing to&lt;br&gt;circulatory disturbances. A mutually facilitatory effect&lt;br&gt;may be presumed between the two polymorphisms.

To date, 25&lt;br&gt;studies have investigated and identified&lt;br&gt;SARS-CoV-2-derived T cell epitopes in humans. Here, we review these&lt;br&gt;recent studies, how they were performed, and their&lt;br&gt;findings. We review how epitopes identified throughout&lt;br&gt;the SARS-CoV2 proteome reveal significant&lt;br&gt;correlation between number of epitopes defined and size of&lt;br&gt;the antigen provenance. We also report additional&lt;br&gt;analysis of SARS-CoV-2 human CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitope&lt;br&gt;data compiled from these studies, identifying 1400&lt;br&gt;different reported SARS-CoV-2 epitopes..."," The nasopharyngeal swab is currently the main&lt;br&gt;testing method used to diagnose COVID-19. The&lt;br&gt;principle is to collect respiratory cells infected by the&lt;br&gt;virus and to use the RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription&lt;br&gt;-Polymerase Chain Reaction) technique to detect the RNA of&lt;br&gt;the virus. The false negative rate is high, about&lt;br&gt;30%, which can mainly be explained by an incorrect&lt;br&gt;execution of the technique may increase the false&lt;br&gt;negative rate and decrease the test's sensitivity. The&lt;br&gt;aim of this note is to help healthcare providers to&lt;br&gt;perform this test correctly in adults and children."," The novel highly transmissible human&lt;br&gt;coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 pandemic. Thus far, there is no approved&lt;br&gt;therapeutic drug, specifically targeting this emerging&lt;br&gt;virus. Here we report the isolation and&lt;br&gt;characterization of a panel of human neutralizing monoclonal&lt;br&gt;antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding&lt;br&gt;domain (RBD). These antibodies were selected from a&lt;br&gt;phage display library constructed using peripheral&lt;br&gt;circulatory lymphocytes collected from patients at the&lt;br&gt;acute phase of the disease.

Our observations&lt;br&gt;suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected&lt;br&gt;in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human&lt;br&gt;transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV.&lt;br&gt;However, no precursors or branches of evolution&lt;br&gt;stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like&lt;br&gt;virus have been detected. The sudden appearance of a&lt;br&gt;highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 presents a major cause..."," Children, because of having an immature immune&lt;br&gt;system, are usually more prone than the adults to the&lt;br&gt;microbial infections and have more severe symptoms,&lt;br&gt;which is especially true for the newborns, and very&lt;br&gt;young children. However, the review of clinical data&lt;br&gt;from the current COVID-19 pandemic indicates&lt;br&gt;otherwise. We discuss here what are the main features and&lt;br&gt;components of children's immune system, the role of&lt;br&gt;maternal transmission of immunity, and what are the&lt;br&gt;possible explanations for the seemingly lower&lt;br&gt;infection rate and severity of COVI-19 in children."," The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected&lt;br&gt;the entire world. The effective implementation of&lt;br&gt;vaccination strategy is critical to prevent the resurgence&lt;br&gt;of the pandemic, especially during large-scale&lt;br&gt;population migration. We establish a multiple patch&lt;br&gt;coupled model based on the transportation network&lt;br&gt;among the 31 provinces in China, under the combined&lt;br&gt;strategies of vaccination and quarantine during&lt;br&gt;large-scale population migration. Based on the model, we&lt;br&gt;derive a critical quarantine rate to control the&lt;br&gt;pandemic transmission and a vaccination rate to achieve&lt;br&gt;herd immunity.

Women are at less risk than men when it&lt;br&gt;comes to developing most infectious diseases.&lt;br&gt;However, understanding these observations requires a&lt;br&gt;gender approach that takes into account an analysis of&lt;br&gt;both biological and social factors. The host's&lt;br&gt;response to infection differs in males and females&lt;br&gt;because sex differences have an impact on hormonal and&lt;br&gt;chromosomal control of immunity. Estradiol appears to&lt;br&gt;confer protective immunity, while progesterone and&lt;br&gt;testosterone suppress anti-infectious responses. In&lt;br&gt;addition, genetic factors, including those associated&lt;br&gt;with sex chromosomes, also affect susceptibility&lt;br&gt;to infections.

The current study identified the potential&lt;br&gt;requirements of dual-income parents toward social robots'&lt;br&gt;diverse childcare functions (e.g., socialization,&lt;br&gt;education, entertainment, and consultation). The&lt;br&gt;results revealed that parental attitudes toward&lt;br&gt;robots were made more positive by all the childcare&lt;br&gt;functions of robots except for their educational&lt;br&gt;features. Furthermore, parents' expectations of&lt;br&gt;childcare functions varied based on their parenting&lt;br&gt;characteristics. Spectral clustering analysis identified&lt;br&gt;distinctive parenting styles (e.g., family-oriented,&lt;br&gt;work-oriented, noninterventional, and dominant), and&lt;br&gt;multigroup structural equation modeling suggested that&lt;br&gt;the impact of robots' socialization function was&lt;br&gt;significant in..."," During the early stages of the COVID-19&lt;br&gt;pandemic in 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the&lt;br&gt;release of individuals incarcerated in New York City&lt;br&gt;jails who were at high risk of contracting the disease&lt;br&gt;and at low risk of committing criminal reoffense.&lt;br&gt;Using public information, we construct and analyze a&lt;br&gt;database of nearly 350,000 incarceration episodes in&lt;br&gt;the city jail system from 2014-2020, paying&lt;br&gt;special attention to what happened during the week of&lt;br&gt;March 23-29, 2020, immediately following the&lt;br&gt;mayor's order.

Recent studies showed that&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 induces the production of factors previously&lt;br&gt;implicated in the reawakening of dormant breast cancer&lt;br&gt;cells such as neutrophil extracellular traps&lt;br&gt;(NETs). The presence of NETs and of a pro-inflammatory&lt;br&gt;microenvironment may therefore promote breast cancer&lt;br&gt;reactivation, increasing the risk of pulmonary metastasis.&lt;br&gt;Further studies will be required to confirm the link&lt;br&gt;between COVID-19 and cancer recurrence.

Guidelines from many&lt;br&gt;organizations require this colonoscopy to be performed&lt;br&gt;within one year after resection. The objective of this&lt;br&gt;study was to evaluate the difference in surveillance&lt;br&gt;colonoscopy rates between white people and African&lt;br&gt;Americans who had their colon tumors resected. The second&lt;br&gt;objective was to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;br&gt;affected these colonoscopy rates.

In earlier literature,&lt;br&gt;the biosensors are operated using the surface&lt;br&gt;interaction with the virus biomolecules that are reflected&lt;br&gt;through a channel or gate. The downside of these types of&lt;br&gt;sensors has limited sensitivity. In this paper, we have&lt;br&gt;considered that the change in the dielectric constant due&lt;br&gt;to virus proteins results in a significant shift&lt;br&gt;in the threshold voltage of FET.

The release of danger-associated&lt;br&gt;molecular patterns during severe COVID-19 results in&lt;br&gt;both pulmonary epithelial damage and inflammatory&lt;br&gt;disease, which are predisposing risk factors for&lt;br&gt;pulmonary aspergillosis. Moreover, collateral effects&lt;br&gt;of host recognition pathways required for the&lt;br&gt;activation of antiviral immunity may, paradoxically,&lt;br&gt;contribute to a highly permissive inflammatory&lt;br&gt;environment that favors fungal pathogenesis.

It is probably based on the ability to generate a&lt;br&gt;latency that keeps viral activity at a very low level,&lt;br&gt;thereby apparently minimising harm to its host.&lt;br&gt;However, this evolutionary success disappears in&lt;br&gt;immunosuppressed patients, especially in haematological&lt;br&gt;patients. The relevance of infection and reactivation in&lt;br&gt;haematological patients has been a matter of interest,&lt;br&gt;although one fundamentally focused on reactivation in&lt;br&gt;the post-allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT)&lt;br&gt;patient cohort.

The higher value consistency, the less&lt;br&gt;self-interest inconsistency, and the perceived efficacy of&lt;br&gt;social distancing mattered for intentions. On the&lt;br&gt;other hand, Study 2 failed to induce value&lt;br&gt;consistency experimentally. However, correlative&lt;br&gt;results show a moderation pattern similar to Study 1&lt;br&gt;regarding social distancing intentions, policy&lt;br&gt;support, and devaluation of transgressors.

The rapid genome sequencing of&lt;br&gt;SARS-CoV-2 strains has become a helpful tool for better&lt;br&gt;understanding the genomic characteristics and origin of the&lt;br&gt;virus. To obtain virus whole-genome sequences&lt;br&gt;directly from clinical specimens, we performed&lt;br&gt;nanopore sequencing using a modified ARTIC protocol in a&lt;br&gt;portable nanopore sequencer and validated a routine 8-h&lt;br&gt;workflow and a 5-h rapid pipeline. We conducted some&lt;br&gt;optimization to improve the genome sequencing workflow. The&lt;br&gt;sensitivity of the workflow was also tested by serially&lt;br&gt;diluting RNA from clinical samples. The optimized&lt;br&gt;pipeline was finally applied to obtain the whole..."," Negative regulators of platelet activation&lt;br&gt;are a relatively unexplored aspect of platelet&lt;br&gt;physiology yet have an important role in tempering&lt;br&gt;thrombus development by contributing much needed&lt;br&gt;negative regulation to a process that is amplified by&lt;br&gt;several positive feedback mechanisms. Some negative&lt;br&gt;regulators, such as RASA3 and JAM-A, act as gatekeepers that&lt;br&gt;modulate key mediators of activation and provide&lt;br&gt;barriers that must be deactivated to permit full&lt;br&gt;activation and stable thrombus formation. Other negative&lt;br&gt;regulators, such as PECAM-1 and other proteins that signal&lt;br&gt;through ITIMs, come into play once platelets are&lt;br&gt;activated and provide restraining, negative feedback&lt;br&gt;for activatory pathways.

Unfortunately, these studies&lt;br&gt;fell short to address disparities in health status&lt;br&gt;and resources among decentralized communities in&lt;br&gt;the United States. In this study, we utilized an&lt;br&gt;advanced modeling technique to examine complex&lt;br&gt;associations of county-level health factors with COVID-19&lt;br&gt;mortality for all 3141 counties in the United States. Our&lt;br&gt;results indicated that counties with more uninsured&lt;br&gt;people, more housing problems, more urbanized areas,&lt;br&gt;and longer commute are more likely to have higher&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 mortality.

When the length of the backtrack is large,&lt;br&gt;the solver can end up reproducing many of the same&lt;br&gt;decisions and propagations when it redescends the search&lt;br&gt;tree. Different techniques have been proposed to&lt;br&gt;reduce this potential redundancy, e.g.,&lt;br&gt;partial/chronological backtracking and trail saving on restarts. In&lt;br&gt;this paper we present a new trail saving technique&lt;br&gt;that is not restricted to restarts, unlike prior&lt;br&gt;trail saving methods.

As the vaccine supply will&lt;br&gt;be limited for a considerable period of time in&lt;br&gt;many countries, it is important to devise the&lt;br&gt;effective vaccination strategies that reduce the number&lt;br&gt;of deaths and incidence of infection. One of the&lt;br&gt;characteristics of COVID-19 is that the symptom, severity, and&lt;br&gt;mortality of the disease differ by age. Thus, when the&lt;br&gt;vaccination supply is limited, age-dependent vaccination&lt;br&gt;priority strategy should be implemented to minimize the&lt;br&gt;incidences and mortalities. In this study, we developed an&lt;br&gt;age-structured model for describing the transmission&lt;br&gt;dynamics of COVID-19, including vaccination. Using..."," Itaconate is a key metabolite in the innate&lt;br&gt;immune system and exerts strong anti-inflammatory&lt;br&gt;effects in macrophages. For the production of&lt;br&gt;itaconate in macrophages, immune-responsive gene 1&lt;br&gt;(IRG1) is an imperative enzyme, and activating the&lt;br&gt;IRG1itaconate pathway is reported to alleviate inflammatory&lt;br&gt;diseases by upregulating nuclear factor-erythroid&lt;br&gt;2-related factor 2 (NRF2). However, there are very few&lt;br&gt;reports on strategies to increase itaconate&lt;br&gt;production. Ultrasound therapy is a widely used&lt;br&gt;intervention for anti-inflammatory and soft-tissue&lt;br&gt;regeneration purposes.

This chapter therefore provides a brief&lt;br&gt;overview of some of the key approaches to ethics with a&lt;br&gt;particular emphasis on virtue ethics and the idea of human&lt;br&gt;flourishing. The chapter reviews the purposes for which AI&lt;br&gt;can be used, as these have a bearing on an ethical&lt;br&gt;evaluation. Three main purposes are distinguished: AI for&lt;br&gt;efficiency, optimisation and profit maximisation, AI for&lt;br&gt;social control and AI for human flourishing. Given the&lt;br&gt;focus on human flourishing in this book, several&lt;br&gt;theoretical..."," The thrombogenic potential of Covid-19 is&lt;br&gt;increasingly recognised. We aim to assess the&lt;br&gt;characteristics of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with pulmonary&lt;br&gt;embolism (PE).\nWe conducted a single centre,&lt;br&gt;retrospective observational cohort study of COVID-19&lt;br&gt;patients admitted between 1 st March and 30 th April 2020&lt;br&gt;subsequently diagnosed with PE following computed&lt;br&gt;tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Patient&lt;br&gt;demographics, comorbidities, presenting complaints and&lt;br&gt;inpatient investigations were recorded.\nWe identified&lt;br&gt;15 COVID-19 patients diagnosed with PE (median&lt;br&gt;age=58 years [IQR=23], 87% male). 2 died (13%), both&lt;br&gt;male patients &gt;70 years.

Differences&lt;br&gt;between sexes have been observed in other infectious&lt;br&gt;diseases and in the response to vaccines. Sex-specific&lt;br&gt;expression patterns of proteins mediating virus binding&lt;br&gt;and entry, and divergent reactions of the immune&lt;br&gt;and endocrine system, in particular the&lt;br&gt;hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, in response to acute stress might explain&lt;br&gt;the higher severity of COVID-19 in men.

Existing assays that directly measure this&lt;br&gt;activity are limited mainly to measurements of up to two&lt;br&gt;specificities in a single reaction. Here, we develop a&lt;br&gt;multiplex cytotoxicity assay that allows direct,&lt;br&gt;simultaneous measurement of up to 23 different&lt;br&gt;specificities of CD8 + T cells in a single reaction. This can&lt;br&gt;greatly reduce the amount of starting clinical&lt;br&gt;materials for a systematic screening of CD8 + T cell&lt;br&gt;epitopes. In addition, this greatly enhanced capacity&lt;br&gt;enables the incorporation of irrelevant epitopes for&lt;br&gt;determining the non-specific killing..."," Rising competition in the retail and&lt;br&gt;hospitality sectors, especially in densely populated and&lt;br&gt;touristic destinations is a growing concern for many&lt;br&gt;business owners, who wish to deliver their brand&lt;br&gt;communication strategy to the target audience. Many of these&lt;br&gt;businesses rely on word-of-mouth marketing, delivering&lt;br&gt;business cards to customers. Furthermore, the lack of a&lt;br&gt;dedicated marketing team and budget for brand image&lt;br&gt;consolidation and design creation often limits the brand&lt;br&gt;expansion capability. The purpose of this study is to&lt;br&gt;propose a novel system prototype that can suggest&lt;br&gt;personalized designs for business cards, based on an&lt;br&gt;existing business card picture. Using perspective..."," The use of population averages in&lt;br&gt;cost-effectiveness analysis may hide important differences&lt;br&gt;across subgroups, potentially resulting in&lt;br&gt;suboptimal resource allocation, reduced population&lt;br&gt;health and/or increased health inequalities. We&lt;br&gt;discuss the factors that limit subgroup analysis in&lt;br&gt;cost-effectiveness analysis and propose more thorough and&lt;br&gt;transparent reporting. There are many issues that may limit&lt;br&gt;whether subgroup analysis can be robustly included in&lt;br&gt;cost-effectiveness analysis, including challenges with&lt;br&gt;prespecifying and justifying subgroup analysis,&lt;br&gt;identifying subgroups that can be implemented (identified&lt;br&gt;and targeted) in practice, resource and data&lt;br&gt;requirements, and statistical and ethical concerns.

However, subclinical&lt;br&gt;neurological involvement may occur anytime, and diagnostic&lt;br&gt;methods that reveal this subclinical involvement are&lt;br&gt;not well established. We aimed to assess the&lt;br&gt;subclinical neurological involvement by visual evoked&lt;br&gt;potential (VEP) measurements and nerve conduction&lt;br&gt;studies (NCS) and explore the relationship between&lt;br&gt;neurological electrophysiological findings and the&lt;br&gt;severity of COVID-19 infection. Methods Seventy-six&lt;br&gt;patients recovered from COVID-19 infection, and 44&lt;br&gt;healthy controls were enrolled in the study.

It remains unclear; however, how&lt;br&gt;plant-plant interactions in diverse systems are mediated&lt;br&gt;by plant genetic variation. We conducted a&lt;br&gt;greenhouse experiment in which we grew three varieties of&lt;br&gt;common beans with three companion plant species&lt;br&gt;(chickpeas, sorghum, and sunflower) in different&lt;br&gt;combinations (crop mixtures, bean cultivar mixtures, and&lt;br&gt;monocultures), with and without drought stress. We&lt;br&gt;hypothesized that under drought stress, the effect of&lt;br&gt;companion plant species on bean yield would be mediated by&lt;br&gt;the drought tolerance potential of the species.

This study&lt;br&gt;aimed to review the COVID-19 pandemic disruption on&lt;br&gt;the management of TB treatment in Indonesia. We&lt;br&gt;identified several disruptions due to the pandemic on TB&lt;br&gt;control management. Firstly, there is a potential&lt;br&gt;decrease in the funding for TB treatment. Financial&lt;br&gt;disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to&lt;br&gt;further setbacks. In many countries, including&lt;br&gt;Indonesia, financial and other resources have been&lt;br&gt;reallocated from TB to the COVID-19 response. Secondly, it&lt;br&gt;has been highlighted that all TB services,&lt;br&gt;including case detection..."," The Covid-19 pandemic is widely speculated to&lt;br&gt;have disrupted the delivery of primary health care&lt;br&gt;in low-income countries. Yet, there is little&lt;br&gt;rigorous empirical research identifying this effect.&lt;br&gt;This paper estimates the impact of Covid-19 on&lt;br&gt;facility and skilled delivery and utilisation of&lt;br&gt;antenatal care (ANC) services by comparing these&lt;br&gt;outcomes for women who were pregnant/delivered before&lt;br&gt;and during the Covid-19 period. The results show&lt;br&gt;that Covid-19 led to 23% and 25% reductions,&lt;br&gt;respectively, in the likelihood of facility delivery and four&lt;br&gt;or more ANC visits during pregnancy.
