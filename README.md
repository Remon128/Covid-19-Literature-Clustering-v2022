# Covid-19-Literature-Clustering-v2022
In this project I am solving a hard problem that face the medical scientists which is searching in large amount of literatures which is related to Covid-19 , so in this Project the matter gone easier for them.

This Project Aims to cluster large amount of literatures into number of similar Groups related to each other, and applying the Topic-Model approach to name a Topic for each cluster to make it easier understanding what every cluster hides and talking about, also by Implementing an Interactive Plot using Bokeh , so that it any one can use by clicking on any cluster and gets the information needed.
